# XSS
## Overview
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability found in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can then be executed in the victim's browser, leading to various harmful outcomes such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites. XSS typically occurs when an application takes user input and includes it in the output without proper validation or escaping. There are three main types of XSS: Stored, Reflected, and DOM-based. Stored XSS is particularly dangerous as the malicious script is permanently stored on the server, making it accessible to all users who visit the affected page.
## Where does it occur?
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities occur in web applications where user input is processed and reflected back in the output without proper validation or escaping. Common areas include
- input fields,
- URL parameters,
- HTTP headers,
- stored data, and
- dynamically generated content.
## How to test?
- **Manual Testing:** Manually input special characters like `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, and `&` into form fields, URL parameters, and other input points to see if they are reflected back in the output without being sanitized.
- **Manual Injection of basic payload:** Inject simple XSS payloads such as `<u>test</u>`, `<h1>test</h1>` and `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into input fields or URL parameters and observe the response. If the script executes, the application is vulnerable.
- **Error-Based Testing:** Injecting payloads that might break the HTML or JavaScript in a way that exposes an error message or reflective behavior can help identify potential XSS issues.
- **DOM-Based XSS Testing:** Inspect the JavaScript code in the browser's developer tools to find instances where user input is being handled insecurely in the DOM. You can manually inject payloads into these points and observe the DOM behavior.
- **Automated Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing tools that generate random or semi-random inputs to test different parts of the application. Fuzzers can help discover unexpected or edge-case XSS vulnerabilities by bombarding input fields with various payloads.
- **Custom Payloads:** Create and use custom payloads tailored to the specific context of the application, such as bypassing common input filters or encoding mechanisms.
- **Manual Testing:** Manually test for DOM XSS by manipulating the DOM directly through the browser's developer tools, injecting payloads into JavaScript functions or variables that handle user input.
- **Encoding and Decoding:** Test how the application handles encoded or double-encoded inputs. Sometimes, encoding can be used to bypass filters, leading to XSS.
- **Evasion Techniques:** Try various evasion techniques to bypass web application firewalls (WAFs) or input filters, such as encoding payloads, using alternative character sets, or breaking payloads into multiple parts.
- **Testing Multiple Vectors:** Some applications may filter specific vectors but be vulnerable to others. Test different vectors like event handlers, CSS, and SVG elements to find potential XSS vulnerabilities.
## Impact
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their accounts.
- **Credential Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to create fake login forms or capture sensitive information like usernames and passwords entered by the user.
- **Unauthorized Actions (Cross-Site Request Forgery - CSRF):** XSS can be used to execute unauthorized actions on behalf of the user, such as changing account settings, making purchases, or transferring funds.
- **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the appearance of a web page, defacing it with unwanted content, which can damage the reputation of the website and the business behind it.
- **Data Theft:** Sensitive data displayed on the web page, such as personal information, credit card details, or confidential messages, can be stolen by the attacker.
- **Spread of Malware:** Attackers can use XSS to inject malicious scripts that redirect users to phishing sites or download and execute malware on their devices.
- **Phishing Attacks:** XSS can be leveraged to create convincing phishing pages within a trusted website, tricking users into disclosing sensitive information.
- **Access to Browser Features:** Attackers can exploit XSS to access features of the victimâ€™s browser, such as the clipboard or camera, if permissions are granted.
- **Undermining User Trust:** If users are subjected to unexpected behavior or malicious content on a trusted site, their trust in the platform can be severely damaged, leading to loss of users and reputation.
- **Escalation of Attacks:** XSS can be used as a stepping stone to other types of attacks, such as exploiting other vulnerabilities in the application or launching more complex attacks like cross-site scripting worms.
- **Regulatory and Legal Consequences:** If XSS leads to a data breach, the affected organization may face legal penalties and fines under data protection regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.
- **Business Impact:** Financial losses due to fraud, legal costs, loss of customers, and the expenses involved in incident response and remediation can be significant.
## Fix
### Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Validate Input:** Ensure all user inputs are validated against expected formats and types. Reject or sanitize input that does not meet criteria.
- **Sanitize Data:** Remove or neutralize potentially harmful characters and content before storing or displaying user input.
### Output Encoding
- **Encode Data:** Use context-specific encoding (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML content, URL encoding for URLs) to ensure that user input is treated as data and not executable code.
- **Use Libraries:** Leverage established libraries and frameworks that handle encoding and escaping to avoid common pitfalls.
### Use Secure APIs
- **Employ Safe Methods:** Use secure APIs and functions provided by frameworks and libraries that automatically handle input sanitization and output encoding.
- **Avoid Directly Writing HTML:** Where possible, use server-side frameworks that automatically handle data encoding.
### Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Define CSP:** Configure a Content Security Policy to restrict the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded, reducing the risk of XSS.
- **Use Nonces or Hashes:** Use nonces or hashes to ensure that only trusted scripts are executed.
### Escape Data Properly
- **HTML Context:** Escape special HTML characters such as `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` when embedding user input in HTML.
- **JavaScript Context:** Properly escape data when injecting it into JavaScript code, avoiding direct insertion of user inputs.
### Implement Input Filtering
- **Filter Input:** Apply filtering mechanisms to block or sanitize potentially dangerous input based on the context in which it is used.
- **Avoid Blacklisting:** Instead of blacklisting specific characters or patterns, use whitelisting approaches to define acceptable input.
### Limit User-Supplied Content
- **Restrict Content Types:** Limit the types of content users can submit or display on the platform, and avoid allowing executable content like scripts in user inputs.
